# State Log — Running Cycle History

Shared log across both active strategies (mean-reversion, momentum/relative-strength). Subordinate to `framework.md`.

**Rules for future instances of yourself:**
- **Always append a new entry. Never overwrite or delete history.** Each cycle gets its own dated, timestamped entry below, oldest first.
- **Pull live data every cycle** — account state, quotes, positions — rather than trusting a prior cycle's narrative. A position can close between cycles (e.g., a manually-enforced stop fills) without this session having initiated it in the current cycle.
- Every entry should contain, in this order: timestamp, stop-check result, account reconciliation, market/sector read, scan results with gate-check verdicts for anything new, entry/exit decisions with trade scores on any close, and a running daily-stats summary.
- `dashboard.html` is rendered from this file (and this file alone, plus its own static shell). Regenerate `dashboard.html` from current state at the end of every cycle, or on request — never hand-edit the dashboard directly.

## Cycle Log

### Cycle 1 — 2026-09-10 19:54 ET (23:54 UTC)

- **Trigger:** Manual — operating loop start-up, requested by user.
- **Stop-check:** N/A — no open positions.
- **Account reconciliation (live pull):** Total value $100.00 · Cash $100.00 · Equity value $0.00 · Buying power $100.00. Matches the $100 baseline exactly. No open positions confirmed via `get_equity_positions`.
- **Market/sector read:** Not performed this cycle — regular session is closed (current time 7:54 PM ET; session hours are 9:30 AM–4:00 PM ET, weekdays). No price-first read is meaningful with the market closed.
- **Scans:** Not run this cycle — both strategies require live, in-session price action (mean-reversion tiers are time-of-session-gated; momentum requires the opening range and intraday relative strength). Full parallel scans resume automatically at the next in-session cycle.
- **Entries/exits:** None.
- **Daily stats:** Unchanged — $0.00 realized/unrealized P&L, 0 trades (organic or forced), daily loss limit not hit, circuit breaker not tripped.
- **Loop status:** Recurring scheduler armed (see below) to resume cycles automatically during the next regular session and every regular session going forward, subject to the session-persistence caveat logged in framework.md §6.
